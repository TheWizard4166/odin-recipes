        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat.<br>
                Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring, until<br>
                tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in plant-based<br>
                sausage, meat substitute crumbles, crushed <br>
                tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, water,<br>
                1 tablespoon parsley, sugar, basil, 1/2 teaspoon<br>
                salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper.<br>
                Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, covered,<br>
                stirring occasionally, until thickened, about<br>
                1 1/2 hours.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.<br>
                Add lasagna noodles; cook 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and<br>
                rinse noodles with cold water.
            </li>

            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
            </li>

            <li>
                Meanwhile, stir together egg, ricotta, remaining<br>
                2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl.
            </li>

            <li>
                To assemble lasagna, spread 1/3 of the sauce in a <br>
                9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise<br>
                over sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta mixture.<br>
                Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella slices. Spoon 1/3 of<br>
                the sauce over mozzarella and sprinkle with 1/4 cup <br>
                Parmesan. Repeat layers and top with remaining <br>
                mozzarella and Parmesan.
            </li>

            <li>
                Bake, covered with cooking spray-coated foil, for<br>
                25 minutes. Remove foil and bake until hot and <br>
                bubbly, about 25 minutes more. Cool for 15 minutes<br>
                before slicing into 12 equal servings.
